Description: This is a package that creates Stable Size Distributions (SSD) and Eggs Per Recruit (EPR) for the seven NERR sites.  The required input data is called Params, which is a list of Params$Sitenames, Params$M, Params$Linf, and Params$k, where Sitenames is the 7 site names, M are mortality rates for the 7 sites, Linf is the max size for the 7 sites, and k is the growth rate for the 7 sites.  The time step in the model is monthly so M and k are converted from daily to monthly rates inside the code.  The other input parameter is CovMats, which is a list containing the 7 covariance matrices for M, Linf, and k for the 7 sites.  The only function you actually need to run yourself is run_EPR_NERR_simple.  First you will load the data, NERRdata.Rdata, and then call run_EPR_NERR_simple(Params,CovMats), where Params and CovMats are both in NERRdata.Rdata
